# keepcli

A simple and unofficial intercatove command line interpreter client for [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/).

This uses the nice unofficial API client [gkeepapi](https://github.com/kiwiz/gkeepapi) 

As described also in that repository, *keepcli* is not supported nor endorsed by Google.

As a very active [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/) user I developed this for my own needs, mainly to add, check and uncheck  TODO items from various list  and add notes quickly when working from a terminal screen . Might be useful for others in a similar situation.

## Installation

    pip install git+https://github.com/mgckind/keepcli.git

## Usage

From a terminal window:

    keepcli
