# keepcli

A simple and unofficial interactive command line interpreter client for [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/).

It uses the nice unofficial API client [gkeepapi](https://github.com/kiwiz/gkeepapi) 

As described also in that repository, *keepcli* is not supported nor endorsed by Google.


## Development

I wanted a simple cli tool that can easily be in sync with multiple devices and although there are alternatives like [todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/) which is an awesome tool, I prefered to keep my quick TODO's and notes in Google Keep, however there is not a public API for it nor a similar cli (given my shallow search).

As a very active [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/) user (among other Notes-taking tools) I developed this for my own needs, mainly to add, check/uncheck  TODO items from various lists  and add notes quickly when working from a terminal screen which is very often, it can switch very easily between notes/lists as well as users. It's been very productive to get things done and multiple TODO list up to date. Might be useful for others in a similar situation.

## Installation

    pip install git+https://github.com/mgckind/keepcli.git

## Usage


From a terminal window:

    keepcli
